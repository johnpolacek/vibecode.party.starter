# Supabase Database Tool Usage

## Description
When making changes that affect the database or when debugging database-related issues, use the `mcp_supabase_query` tool to check the current state of the database.

## When to Use
1. When modifying database-related code
2. When debugging data issues
3. When verifying data transformations
4. When checking relationships between tables

## Example Queries

### Check Sponsors Table
```sql
SELECT 
  hs.*,
  hst.name as tier_name,
  hst.fixed_amount as tier_fixed_amount,
  hst.minimum_amount as tier_minimum_amount
FROM hackathon_sponsors hs
LEFT JOIN hackathon_sponsor_tiers hst ON hs.tier_id = hst.id
WHERE hs.hackathon_id = '[hackathon_id]';
```

### Check Sponsor Tiers
```sql
SELECT * FROM hackathon_sponsor_tiers 
WHERE hackathon_id = '[hackathon_id]'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check User's Sponsorships
```sql
SELECT 
  hs.*,
  h.title as hackathon_title,
  hst.name as tier_name
FROM hackathon_sponsors hs
JOIN hackathons h ON hs.hackathon_id = h.id
LEFT JOIN hackathon_sponsor_tiers hst ON hs.tier_id = hst.id
WHERE hs.created_by = '[user_id]';
```

## Best Practices
1. Always include relevant JOIN tables to get complete context
2. Use descriptive aliases for table names
3. Include ORDER BY clauses when sequence matters
4. Use WHERE clauses to limit results to relevant data
5. Include created_at/updated_at in results when debugging timing issues

## Security Notes
1. Never expose sensitive data in logs
2. Use parameterized queries when possible
3. Only query necessary columns
4. Remember this is read-only access
